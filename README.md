# asteroids

This is a simple [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) clone written in C++. The project serves as an exercise in using CMake and Git to target multiple platforms, as well as a dive into the basics of video game architecture using very simple OOP practices. The project uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), a multimedia library with support for multiple platforms, although presently the project is only being developed and tested on Windows.

## Building

In order to build the project on Windows, you will need CMake and MSVC or an equivalent compiler. After cloning or downloading this repository, building should be as simple as executing the `build.cmd` file at the root of the project. It is not required (but recommended nonetheless) to run this build script from the command line so that you are able to read any error messages.
